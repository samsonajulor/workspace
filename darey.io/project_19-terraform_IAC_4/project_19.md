# Automate Infrastructure With IaC using Terraform. Part 4 – Terraform Cloud

**What Terraform Cloud is and why use it**
By now, you should be pretty comfortable writing Terraform code to provision Cloud infrastructure using [Configuration Language (HCL)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/). Terraform is an open-source system, that you installed and ran a Virtual Machine (VM) that you had to create, maintain and keep up to date. In Cloud world it is quite common to provide a managed version of an open-source software. Managed means that you do not have to install, configure and maintain it yourself – you just create an account and use it "as A Service".

[Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud) is a managed service that provides you with Terraform CLI to provision infrastructure, either on demand or in response to various events.

By default, Terraform CLI performs operation on the server when it is invoked, it is perfectly fine if you have a dedicated role who can launch it, but if you have a team who works with Terraform – you need a consistent remote environment with remote workflow and shared state to run Terraform commands.

Terraform Cloud executes Terraform commands on disposable virtual machines, this remote execution is also called [remote operations](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/run/index.html).

## Migrate your .tf codes to Terraform Cloud
Le us explore how we can migrate our codes to Terraform Cloud and manage our AWS infrastructure from there:

1. Create a Terraform Cloud account
Follow [this link](https://app.terraform.io/signup/account), create a new account, verify your email and you are ready to start

Most of the features are free, but if you want to explore the difference between free and paid plans – you can check it on [this page](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

2. Create an organization
Select "Start from scratch", choose a name for your organization and create it.

3. Configure a workspace
Before we begin to configure our workspace – watch [this part](https://youtu.be/m3PlM4erixY?t=287) of the video to better understand the difference between version control workflow, CLI-driven workflow and API-driven workflow and other configurations that we are going to implement.

We will use version control workflow as the most common and recommended way to run Terraform commands triggered from our git repository.

Create a new repository in your GitHub and call it terraform-cloud, push your Terraform codes developed in the previous projects to the repository.

Choose version control workflow and you will be prompted to connect your GitHub account to your workspace – follow the prompt and add your newly created repository to the workspace.

Move on to "Configure settings", provide a description for your workspace and leave all the rest settings default, click "Create workspace".

4. Configure variables
Terraform Cloud supports two types of variables: environment variables and Terraform variables. Either type can be marked as sensitive, which prevents them from being displayed in the Terraform Cloud web UI and makes them write-only.

Set two environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, set the values that you used in Project 16. These credentials will be used to provision your AWS infrastructure by Terraform Cloud.

After you have set these 2 environment variables – your Terraform Cloud is all set to apply the codes from GitHub and create all necessary AWS resources.

5. Now it is time to run our Terraform scripts, but in our previous project which was project 18, we talked about using Packer to build our images, and Ansible to configure the infrastructure, so for that we are going to make few changes to our our existing repository from Project 18.
The files that would be Added is;

- AMI: for building packer images
- Ansible: for Ansible scripts to configure the infrastructure

Before you proceed ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine;

- packer
- Ansible

Refer to this [repository](https://github.com/darey-devops/PBL-project-19.git) for guidance on how to refactor your environment to meet the new changes above and ensure you go through the README.md file.

6. Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` from web console

Switch to "Runs" tab and click on "Queue plan manually" button. If planning has been successful, you can proceed and confirm Apply – press "Confirm and apply", provide a comment and "Confirm plan"

![confirm plan](./images/run%20plan%20successful.png)

Check the logs and verify that everything has run correctly. Note that Terraform Cloud has generated a unique state version that you can open and see the codes applied and the changes made since the last run.

7. Test automated `terraform plan`
By now, you have tried to launch plan and apply manually from Terraform Cloud web console. But since we have an integration with GitHub, the process can be triggered automatically. Try to change something in any of .tf files and look at "Runs" tab again – plan must be launched automatically, but to apply you still need to approve manually. Since provisioning of new Cloud resources might incur significant costs. Even though you can configure "Auto apply", it is always a good idea to verify your plan results before pushing it to apply to avoid any misconfigurations that can cause ‘bill shock’.

**Note:** First, try to approach this project on your own, but if you hit any blocker and could not move forward with the project, refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/nCemvjcKuIA)

## Practice Task №1
1. Configure 3 branches in your terraform-cloud repository for dev, test, prod environments
2. Make necessary configuration to trigger runs automatically only for dev environment
3. Create an Email and Slack notifications for certain events (e.g. started plan or errored run) and test it
4. Apply destroy from Terraform Cloud web console

## Public Module Registry vs Private Module Registry
Terraform has a quite strong community of contributors (individual developers and 3rd party companies) that along with HashiCorp maintain a [Public Registry](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/index.html), where you can find reusable configuration packages ([modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/modules/use.html)). We strongly encourage you to explore modules shared to the public registry, specifically for this project – you can check out [this AWS provider registry page](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/latest).

As your Terraform code base grows, your DevOps team might want to create you own library of reusable components – [Private Registry](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/private.html) can help with that.

## Practice Task №2 Working with Private repository
1. Create a simple Terraform repository (you can clone one [from here](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-private-module-aws-s3-webapp)) that will be your module
2. Import the module into your private registry
3. Create a configuration that uses the module
4. Create a workspace for the configuration
5. Deploy the infrastructure
6. Destroy your deployment
